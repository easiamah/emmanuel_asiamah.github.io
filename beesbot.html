					say.  There are emoji's that tells how you did on the test you take in the next user flow.
					<br /> Excellent - üî•

					shows details and progress of that question. On top of the flashcard, a detail of that information
					of the card is given. On the navigation above the detail, is the switch to choose between only
					studying one flashcard or the entire flashcard. When a flashcard is tapped, it flips. When
					going through the entire flashcard, swiping on the flashcards will present another card if any.

					the test page for that lesson. Your progress for that lesson is automatically saved.

					the rectangular space above
					the answer text field. Your progress is assessed based on how accurate your answer is compared to
					the
					answer you provided. Your progress is saved for reference later. A timer starts right when the
					test begins to keep track of how fast you are able to finish the test. There is a settings button in
					the navigation bar that allows you to change how the test should be taken to your preference.
					Whether written, true or false, or multiple choice. You can set levels of difficulty, you can choose
					how many questions you would like to answer, you can also schedule when to take a test as well.
